**dhSegment** is a tool for Historical Document Processing. Its generic approach allows to segment regions and
extract content from different type of documents. See some example of applications in the :ref:`usecases-label` section.

The complete description of the system can be found in the corresponding `paper`_ :cite:`oliveiraseguin2018dhsegment` .
